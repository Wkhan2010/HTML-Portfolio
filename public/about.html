<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  <br>I'm Wally Khan, a former teacher and graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in History. 
   When the pandemic hit, I discovered a newfound love for computer programming.</br>
   Currently residing in Texas I enjoy engaging in team sports and dedicating my free time to learning new programming languages.
   Combining my background in education with my growing skills in programming, 
   I'm excited to embark on a new journey as a software developer, bringing a unique perspective to the field.
